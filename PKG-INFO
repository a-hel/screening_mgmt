Description: =====================
        Screening mangagement
        =====================
        
        Screening_mgmt is a tool to read, process and display data from
        various screening assays in a uniform manner. It provides a gra-
        phical user interface (GUI) to facilitate the user interactions.
        
        To start the GUI, run the following command:
        
            import screening_mgmt as sm
            sm.main_menu()
        
        Alternatively, you can directly run the ``__init.py__`` file and 
        choose mode ”g”.
