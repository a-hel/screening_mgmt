Screening_mgmt is a tool to read, process and display data from
various screening assays in a uniform manner. It provides a gra-
phical user interface (GUI) to facilitate the user interactions.

To start the GUI, run the following command:

    import screening_mgmt as sm
    sm.main_menu()

Alternatively, you can directly run the ``__init.py__`` file and 
choose mode ”g”.
